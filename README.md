# Practical Blockchain Training
## Overview 
Blockchain is a distributed database replicated across multiple nodes to enable immutable, permanent, transparent, and secure record-keeping of transactions. At its core, the technology allows for the brokerage of data and establishes trust among distributed participants without the need for a centralized authority. The decentralization of trust has given rise to new applications, including cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This course provides practical training for technology professionals to support the growing demand for skilled Blockchain professionals. During the course, students will be exposed to multiple blockchain implementation concepts and be immersed in a unique guideline for sustainable and scalable blockchain development using quantum-resistant ledgers. They will learn how to create nodes on your personal Ethereum blockchain, create accounts, unlock accounts, mine, transact, transfer Ethers, and check balances.
